# fugitive-extras

Additions to [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): review a
branch the way a pull request shows it, keeping each review as a comparison,
stage hunks in a vertical diff, and leave review comments on the branch,
saved per branch.

"Main" is the repo's default branch: `origin/HEAD`, else `origin/main`,
`origin/master`, `main` or `master`, resolved per repo when a command runs.
Diffs are against the **merge-base** of `HEAD` and main, so they show only
what this branch changes, as of where it forked. In every diff the older side
is on the left, so what was added is on the right.
`:BranchDiff` shows what the branch's commits change, as the PR would;
`:BranchDiff!` and `:DiffThis!` show the work tree, uncommitted changes
included. `:DiffCommit` is the exception: one commit's change, from its
parent, and `:DiffCommit!` from its parent to the work tree.

The `:Branch*` commands show the branch like a PR's tabs on GitHub: its
changed files as diffs, and its commits. They take a
branch, local or remote, to review it without checking it out:
`:BranchDiff origin/feature`.
Diffs are then from that branch's merge-base with main to its last commit.
`<Tab>` completes branches, most recent first. Run `:Git fetch` first to see
new remote branches.

| Command | `<Plug>` mapping | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:DiffThis` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-this)` | `:Gvdiffsplit`: index on the left, working tree on the right. `dp` on a hunk in the working tree stages it, `do` in the index unstages it; `:w` the index buffer to keep it. |
| `:DiffThis!` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-main)` | The current file at the merge-base on the left, working tree on the right: what the branch changes in it (*not yet*: with `'splitright'` set, the merge-base is on the right). |
| `:DiffCommit [rev]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-commit)` | The current file as the last commit changed it: `HEAD^` on the left, `HEAD` on the right. With `rev` (`:DiffCommit HEAD~3`, a branch), that commit and its parent (*not yet*: with `'splitright'` set, the parent is on the right; the same for `:DiffCommit!`). |
| `:DiffCommit! [rev]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-commit-worktree)` | The commit's parent on the left, working tree on the right: what the commit changed and what came since, uncommitted too, as `!` is for `:BranchDiff!`. |
| `:BranchDiff [branch]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-branch-diff)` | One tab per file the branch's commits change, each already a diff from the merge-base, on the left, to the branch's last commit, on the right (`:Git difftool -y`), listed in `:Compares`. Both sides are read-only. The diffs are of commits only; for uncommitted changes too, a stash you applied say, `:BranchDiff!`. |
| `:BranchDiff!` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-branch-diff-worktree)` | The checked-out branch's work tree instead, committed or not: the merge-base on the left, its files as they are now on the right, to edit and stage in the diff. |
| `:DiffRefresh` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-refresh)` | In a `:BranchDiff` tab, its comparison again as `:BranchDiff` would open it now, under the same name: from a new merge-base, files changed since get tabs and those no longer changed lose theirs, and you're back on the file you were on. For after an agent edits or commits. Its tabs must have no unsaved changes. In another diff, both sides read again. Either way, buffers changed outside Vim are read again, `'autoread'` or not. |
| `:BranchCommits [branch] [args]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-branch-commits)` | Commits on the branch that main lacks (`git log base..branch`), newest first, in a [vim-lists](https://github.com/roumail/vim-lists) list: hash, author, age, subject. `<CR>` opens a commit in fugitive, in the window above; `/` filters on subject, author and hash; `r` refreshes; `q` closes. Extra args pick which commits, as `git log`'s do: `:BranchCommits --author=mira`, `:BranchCommits -- %` (the commits that change this file). Each commit stays one line; for `--stat` and the like, `:Git log`. |
| `:DiffClose [name]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-close)` | Close the tabs of a `:BranchDiff` comparison: `name` (`<Tab>` completes names), else the one this tab is in. From one of its tabs, go back to the window `:BranchDiff` was run from. It stays in `:Compares`; a tab with unsaved changes stays open. Outside a comparison, close the `fugitive://` windows in this tab and `:diffoff!`. |
| `:Compares` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-compares)` | The comparisons `:BranchDiff` opened, newest first (see below). |


Reviewing a PR: check it out (`gh pr checkout`, or `:PRs` in
[gh-extras](https://github.com/vimoured/gh-extras)), then `:BranchDiff` and
`:BranchCommits`.

## Comparisons

Each `:BranchDiff` is kept as a comparison, as in GitLens' Search & Compare:
named for the branch (the current branch's name without one), with the
merge-base it diffed against and its head: the branch, or the work tree
for `:BranchDiff!`. Its tabs carry its name, so closing the files
that raise no questions leaves the ones that do, and other plugins can read
which ([For other plugins](#for-other-plugins)). A comparison stays listed until you remove it, even
with all its tabs closed, for the rest of the Vim session. Another
`:BranchDiff` of the same branch reuses a comparison of it with no tabs open;
while every one of them still has tabs, it starts a new one, `feature#2`,
`feature#3`, …, so you can keep different files of the same branch open in
each.

`:Compares` lists them in a window at the bottom: name, `base..head` (`work tree`
when uncommitted changes are in it), files, how many of its tabs are open,
and age.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | Close the list and open all its files again, in new tabs, against the same merge-base. `:DiffRefresh` in one of its tabs, or `:BranchDiff` again, to diff against a new one. |
| `dd` | Remove it from the list. Its tabs stay open. To close them too, run `:DiffClose <name>` before removing it. |
| `/` | Filter the list as you type, on name, branch and head. |
| `r` | Refresh. The cursor stays on its comparison. |
| `q` | Close (`:q` too: the list has its own window). |

The list is a [vim-lists](https://github.com/roumail/vim-lists) list: `dd`,
`/`, `r` and `q` are the same as in the other lists.

## Review comments

Comments on a line or a range of a file, collected in a quickfix list of
their own, titled `Review`, apart from grep or diff results, saved and loaded
back.

| Command | `<Plug>` mapping | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:[range]Comment [text]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-comment)` (normal and visual), which leaves `:Comment ` on the command line to finish | Add a comment on the line or range; prompts unless `text` is given. Leaving the prompt with `<Esc>` keeps what you typed: `:Comment` or `:CommentDraft` on the same lines goes on from it. |
| `:[range]CommentDraft [text]` | `<Plug>(fugitive-extras-comment-draft)` (normal and visual) | Write the comment in a markdown buffer of 10 lines split below, starting with `text` if given, else with what you left at the `:Comment` prompt on those lines, for longer or multi-line comments. A [vim-draft](https://github.com/roumail/vim-draft) draft: `:w` saves, closing the buffer (`:wq`, or `:q` after `:w`) adds the comment last saved, and an empty one or `:q!` before any `:w` drops it. |
| `:Comments` | | Open the `Review` list. In it, `c` opens the comment on the line in a draft, all of it, to read or change: saved and closed, it replaces the comment. Deleting one is up to a quickfix list's `dd`, as [qf-tools](https://github.com/roumail/qf-tools) binds it. |
| `:CommentsSave [file]` | | Write the comments in [vim-review](https://github.com/roumail/vim-review)'s format, their [anchors](#anchors) in `<file>.anchors` beside it, so the file reads as plain comments. Without `file`, each save is a new file named for the time (see below). |
| `:CommentsLoad [file]` | | Replace the `Review` list with the comments in the file, each moved to where its lines are now; without `file`, the latest save of the branch. `<Tab>` lists the saves, newest first, then files. |
| `:CommentsClear` | | Empty the `Review` list, as quitting Vim would. Saves are kept, so `:CommentsLoad` brings them back. |

- In a repository, a comment goes on a file in the work tree or on the
  branch side of a diff; the merge-base side is refused. Paths are relative
  to the repo root.
- Outside a repository, a comment goes on a file under the current
  directory, with paths relative to it, and saves are kept per directory
  (where vim-place keeps plugins' files outside a repository). The points
  below about branches are for a repository.
- Comments are on the branch a tab's comparison diffs (`:BranchDiff feature`),
  else on the checked-out branch, so two comparisons of different branches
  open at once keep their comments apart; comparisons of the same branch
  share them. A remote branch counts as its local one: `origin/feature` is
  `feature`.
- Saves without a file name are per branch and time,
  `fugitive-extras/comments/<branch>/<YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>.txt` in the git dir
  (where vim-place keeps plugins' files), outside the work tree, so reviews
  of different branches stay apart.
- The saves of a deleted branch are deleted: those of a branch that is
  neither local nor any remote's, nor anything else naming a commit (a tag,
  or the commit of a detached HEAD). Once a merged branch's local one is
  deleted, its remote one goes once GitHub deletes it and you fetch with
  `--prune`. They are looked for the first time comments are used in a Vim
  session, and after every `:Git` command. Which were deleted is in
  `:messages`.
- Switching branches with `:Git checkout`, or commenting in a tab of another
  branch's comparison, empties the `Review` list when its comments are
  saved, so they aren't taken for the new branch's (`:CommentsLoad` on their
  branch brings them back). While any is unsaved, added or changed since the
  last save, it warns instead and nothing is cleared.

To take a comment you're typing to an editor, change `Comment` to
`CommentDraft` on the command line (`<C-b>` goes to its start) and press
Enter: the draft starts with your text. A command line left with `<Esc>` is
in the history, so `:<Up>` gets it back after you look something up.

### Anchors

While a file is open, its comments move with your edits, as quickfix entries
do. A save can be loaded after the file changed outside Vim, though (a `git
pull`, a rebase, an agent's edit), so each comment is saved with an anchor:
a line of JSON in `<file>.anchors` with its lines (up to 20) and the 2 on either side.

`:CommentsLoad` looks for those lines, ignoring indentation, and moves the
comment to them. Where they appear more than once, it takes the place with
the most matching lines around it, then the nearest to the saved line. A
comment whose lines are gone stays at its saved line, marked `W` in
`:Comments`, and keeps its anchor through later saves, so it is found again if
its lines come back.

*Not yet* marks a known bug: [vim-suite](https://github.com/vimoured/vim-suite)
asserts the behaviour described (its `test/known-failures.txt`), and the note
goes once it's fixed.

## Keys

The one key bound is `c` in the `Review` list; bind the `<Plug>` mappings
yourself, for example:

```vim
nmap <leader>cd <Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-main)
nmap <leader>cr <Plug>(fugitive-extras-diff-refresh)
nmap <leader>cl <Plug>(fugitive-extras-branch-commits)
nmap <leader>cc <Plug>(fugitive-extras-comment)
xmap <leader>cc <Plug>(fugitive-extras-comment)
```

## For other plugins

| Function | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `fugitive_extras#comments#list()` | The review comments as `{path, start, end, body, orphaned?}`: `path` relative to the repo root, `start` and `end` the first and last line, the same for a single line; `orphaned` when its lines weren't found on load. |
| `fugitive_extras#comments#load([file])` | Replace the `Review` list with the comments in `file`, else the branch's latest save, as `:CommentsLoad`. |
| `fugitive_extras#comments#check()` | Warn when the unsaved comments are from another branch than now. |
| `fugitive_extras#complete_branch(lead, cmdline, pos)` | The local and remote branches starting with `lead`, most recently committed first, as `:BranchDiff` completes them; a `-complete=customlist` function. |
| `fugitive_extras#main_ref()` | Main as a ref (`origin/main`, `main`, …) in the current buffer's repo, or `''`. |
| `fugitive_extras#compares#list([gitdir])` | The comparisons in the repo at `gitdir` (default: the current buffer's), newest first, as `{name, branch, base, head, files, time, tabs}`: `branch` is what it was
named for (`name` may add `#2`), `head` is `''` for the work tree, `tabs` the tab numbers still showing it. |

## Install

The core is fugitive-extras and
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive):

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'vimoured/fugitive-extras'
```

That gives you the diffs, `:DiffThis`, `:DiffThis!`, `:DiffCommit`, `:BranchDiff`, `:DiffRefresh` and
`:DiffClose`, with each `:BranchDiff` kept as a comparison, and
`fugitive_extras#main_ref()` and `fugitive_extras#compares#list()` for other
plugins.

Each row below adds a module on top of the core, and **Needs** is the whole
set of plugins it takes besides the core; without them, the command says
which it needs:

| Needs | Module | Adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [vim-lists](https://github.com/roumail/vim-lists) | Lists | `:Compares`, the comparisons; `:BranchCommits`, the branch's commits |
| [vim-place](https://github.com/roumail/vim-place) | Review comments | `:Comment`, `:Comments`, `:CommentsClear`, and `fugitive_extras#comments#list()` |
| vim-place + [vim-draft](https://github.com/roumail/vim-draft) | Comments in a draft | `:CommentDraft` |
| vim-place + [vim-review](https://github.com/roumail/vim-review) | Saved comments | `:CommentsSave` and `:CommentsLoad` in vim-review's format, kept per branch where vim-place keeps plugins' files |

All of it:

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'roumail/vim-lists'
Plug 'roumail/vim-place'
Plug 'roumail/vim-draft'
Plug 'roumail/vim-review'
Plug 'vimoured/fugitive-extras'
```

## Tests

Tested by [vim-suite](https://github.com/vimoured/vim-suite), in
`test/fugitive-extras.vim`, with the dotfiles that use it. Every pull request
runs them.
